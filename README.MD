# Natural Language Interface for Tabular Data

This project enables users to query tabular datasets using **natural language** instead of SQL.  
It combines **Hugging Face’s FLAN-T5** with **logic-based parsing in pandas** to interpret queries and generate accurate answers from structured data.

## 🚀 Features
- Handle 35+ query variations (aggregation, filtering, comparisons).  
- Combines transformer models with logic-based evaluation for accuracy.  
- Works with CSV/Excel input files (`input_table.csv`).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**, **pandas**, **NumPy**  
- **Hugging Face Transformers (FLAN-T5)**  
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook**
